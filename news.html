      <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-2">By Sports Desk | August 28, 2025</p>
      <img src="https://www.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Jalen-Hurts-090924-1.jpg" alt="Jalen Hurts" class="w-full h-48 object-cover mb-4 border border-gray-900">
      <p class="text-gray-900">This basically comes down to style of play. MLB would have the bruisers up front- think schwarber, prince fielder, fuckin Daniel vogelbach. But NBA has 7 footers who are freak athletes. Who is covering Kevin Durant split out wide? How do wee even simulate this?

I personally am taking MLB. Cut blocks will be legal to support my opinion. I also think nbc players just call for fouls too often so the physicality may be too much. Yeah point for Jordan over Lebrun, this era is soft.

Also im sure MLB players would be nasty qbs. Kevin love likely quarterbacks the NBA team have you seen his outlet passes? Maybe later on well break down the rosters but today with 0 info I’m going MLB</p>

      <p class="text-gray-900">Face it Lebron dick riders- he’s got a year or two left. Arguably he is already not the face of the league. So lets look at potential contenders for who’s next

5) Luka - obviously taking his team over gives him a shot. But realistically he puts off the vibe that he’s just never going to develop into an all around killer. But he’s sick so he gets the fifth spot.

4) SGA - honestly I don’t like this guy. Oooo look at me im map and champion. Yeah ok buddy look what presti put around you. He’s the nab Jalen hurts and he even looks like him. And the foul baiting actually,…..maybe he is Lebrun in that way

3) Anthony Edwards - easily could eb the face of the league, already a movie star. In the small market hopelessly cursed Minnesota area, he has to become the villain, like Lebrun, and sign with the heat and start a dynasty. Watch out for this

2) Jokic love this guy and while he’s the best player in the world. He just doesn’t give a fuck and I respect it. Imagine if he was jacked and athletic? How’s that for a take you’ve never heard?

Giannis. In my opinion he is the king. Yeah he’s been hurt but he’s a fucking freak that is developing his jump shot. There are always rumors of him wanting out, and the front office seems to love lubing him up and fucking him. But he already won his chip thanks to the cp3 curse, and he’s still young. He’s the most dominant force when healthy. Basically I’m sucking him off to come to the KNICKSSSSSS</p>

      <p class="text-gray-900">5) walking arounda  Baseball stadium

Something about the pavilion encompasses shot dogs beers and popcorn like no other sport.

4) your next beer as you lift it up

Drinking outside is truly americas pastime. The smell gradually fades as you make yourself more retarded, but for the first 4-5 that crisp boozy smell is second to none. Well fourth in this case

3) hockey arena there really is no smell. But you know what I mean. Something about the cool air is intoxicating. If you have never experienced this, go to a game asap and it will just click. Its like doing frozen cocaine

2) new oiled baseball glove - yeah you freaks you can oil something up and not fuck it. If you were a kid and rubbed that shit on your glove - not your dick - that shits the best. Especially after you run it over with your car. Again your glove, not your dick, perverts

TIE - fresh cut grass, new football

I didn’t plan this but in remembered the baseball glove smell as I was writing this. Grass especially any a baseball stadium fucks. Also, a new football scent is basically the glove smell but there is something different. Something that you don’t want to fuck but you want to carry you home and tuck you in</p>
