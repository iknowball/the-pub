Homemade mashed potatoes 
 Undisputed goat. Your mom whips these up with steak or thanksgiving food and it bangs every time. Play the hits

2) steakhouse garlic mashed potatoes 

Also bangs but more volatile. Debate a wall

3) baked potato

You may be thinking where are fries? Ok you fat fuck go stuff your face with McDonalds and come back and by the time you’re done fries will be on here

4) sweet potato

Shits so good. Yeah and its healthy this may be a contender for dark horse pick of the millennium. With a little salmon or some bullshit this jumps to the top of the list

5) hashbrowns. Yup I’m taking this over fries. Fry category is way too large. A nice hash brown the day after a hangover, fuck yeah
